WriteRoom.ws is designed for WriteRoom.iPhone users who want to sync their writing online. WriteRoom.ws stores your writing so that is is always available, even when you don't have your iPhone. Unlike the iPhone's default Notes app, WriteRoom.ws allows you to sync anywhere, not just when you are tethered to your computer.

◆ Beta. Things may change and go wrong.
◆ Human Sized. For your writing and notes. Not for huge files.
◆ Light Security. Not for sensitive information, credit cards, passwords, etc.
